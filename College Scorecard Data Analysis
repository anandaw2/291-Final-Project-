It includes detailed metrics on colleges and universities across the United States, such as tuition costs, graduation rates, median earnings of graduates, and student demographics.

The specific dataset used for this analysis contains variables relevant to predicting the median earnings of graduates 10 years after enrollment.

# Research Question/Purpose

- **Type:** Numeric  
- **Units:** U.S. dollars  
- **Range:** \$0 to \$200,000  
- **Description:** This variable represents the median earnings of students who received federal financial aid 10 years after enrollment.

# Exploratory Visualizations
To explore the relationships between variables of interest, two visualizations were created:

```{r}
scorecard <- read.csv("MERGED2022_23_PP.csv")


new_scorecard <- select(scorecard, MD_EARN_WNE_P10, C100_4, NPT4_PUB, NPT4_PRIV, CONTROL, STUFACR, REGION)
```
